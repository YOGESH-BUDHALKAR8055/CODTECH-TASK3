## TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY MONITORING 
A Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using a DHT11 sensor, an LCD display, and ESP32 is a great project to learn about sensor interfacing and real-time data display. Here's an overview:

## Objective
Design a system to measure temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor, display the values on an LCD, and optionally send the data to a web interface or IoT platform.

## Components Required
ESP32 - Microcontroller for data processing and control.
DHT11 Sensor - Measures temperature and humidity.
16x2 LCD Display - Displays temperature and humidity readings.
I2C LCD Module (optional) - Simplifies LCD connections using I2C protocol.
Resistor - For pull-up (usually 10kΩ, if needed for DHT11).
Breadboard - For prototyping.
Jumper Wires - For connections.
